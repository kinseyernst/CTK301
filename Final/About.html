<h1>About Me</h1>

<main>
<div id="paragraph">
<p>I am currently an undergrad student at Illinois State University in the Wonsook Kim College of Arts as a Junior. As a student in the Creative Technologies: Audio & Music Production program, I've been given to oppportunity to enhance my sound design and production skills. To gain more hands on expereince, I am a production intern for ISU's radio WZND. Here, I use Adobe Audition to create and produce scripts, liners, and sweepers to keep the station's image fresh and relevant. On my own time, I write, record, and produce my own music on my computer using Logic. Being a self-taught musician, I've been able to effectively teach myself how to use recording equipment such as microphones, interfaces, and DAWs. Now, with a semester of web design under my belt, I can bring my portfolio to life. </p>

<p>Additionally, I explore another creative side of myself through art and photography. Before I became a Creative Technologies major, I was in the graphic design program at the University of Minnestoa Twin Cities. There, I took Drawing & Painting, as well as multiple other foundations classes, where I learned how to create art with different mediums, such as charcoal and acryclic paint. However, since graphic design focused primarily in a digital format, I took to digital drawing the most. I am inspired by the 
"cartoon" aesthetic when drawing a self-portrait or images of others. </p>
