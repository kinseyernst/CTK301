<h2>SFX Narrative</h2>

  <p>For this project, I was instructed to create a "Special Effects Narrative." This involves using onyl sound effects (no music or dialogue) to tell a story. For my narrative, I drew inspiration from Jurassic Park, where the T-Rex first appears in the rain. Using a SFX library online, I was able to construct this idea. </p>

<div id="recompose">
<h2>Recomposing</h2>

  <p>Timing is everything in sound design. Sometimes, a longer sequence needs to get cut down in order to fit a time-constraint. For this project, I had to take a song over 5 minutes long and recompose it to be under 2 minutes. I chose the song "Uprising" by Muse, as it was a song I knew very well. In order to cut the length of this song down without having it sound "off," I reconstructed the entire bridge, as well as shortening verses and the chorus.</p>

<div id="EQ">
<h2>Equalization</h2>

  <p>Equalization is a common and effective tool in all aspects of audio editing, whether that be music production or sound design. In these audio clips, the same song is used. However, each will sound different, as I adjusted the EQ to achieve a desired effect.</p>

<div id="underscore">
<h2>Underscore</h2>

  <p>Underscores are apart of every film. For this particular assignment, I chose an audio clip from A Star is Born and added different underscores to change the feel of the scene. The first 2 clips include music, while the last clip is an ambient setting.</p>

<div id="bt">
<h2>Beautiful/Terrible</h2>
  <p>What makes a sound "beautiful" or "terrible"? For this assignment, I had to create each of these descriptors in the form of an audio clip. To start, I found audio online that matched the idea of beautiful and terrible. Then, I used EQ, fade-ins/fade-outs, and distortion until I felt these clips truly embodied the feel of the assignment. Warning: do not listen to the "terrible" clip at a high volume... after all it is terrible.</p>
